## ‚úíÔ∏è About me

I previously worked for __Axa and Ubisoft__, two great experiences that taught me a lot. Now __I am looking for a great opportunity__ that will help me achieve my new career goal, so please don't hesitate to __contact me__!

C#, Python, Java, .NET, ASP.NET Core, SQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Git, Github, Github Desktop, SourceTree, GitKraken, Unreal Engine, Unity, After Effects, Premier Pro, Photoshop, Illustrator, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter... _And surely other things !_
